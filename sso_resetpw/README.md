# SSO Password Reset Tool

## Overview
This tool is designed to simplify the process of password resets for administrators. Instead of manually searching for users in the console to send a password reset email, this tool provides a more efficient method by automating the process.

## How It Works
1. Administrator Login: The administrator logs into the system.
2. User Search: Using the SSO user profiles, the administrator searches for the user who requires a password reset.
3. Send Reset Request: Once the user is identified, the administrator sends a password reset request through the API.

## Requirements
- Access to the SSO administrator account.
- Network access to the SSO user profile API.

## Current Status
Currently, the SSO reset password API is not available, leaving this tool incomplete. We are awaiting the release of the API to fully implement all features. Updates will be provided as more information becomes available.
